## Notes
- Inside of the light tube should be either printed from black non-reflective material or painted black to reduce reflections, inside of the light box should be white.
- All parts have an orientation in which they should print without supports.
- Most holes are blinded to change floating skin layers into bridges. The blindings need to be driled or poked through.
- No more documentation, you will figure it out :-)

## BOM
1. 1x each file from the directory [stl](stl/), except [screw\_handle\_m5.stl](stl/screw_handle_m5.stl)
1. [Micro 4/3 to T2 adapter](https://www.aliexpress.com/item/32812852122.html) with removed T2 thread insert.

1. 40mm x 45mm x 2mm diffusing white acrylic sheet
  ...or anything else translucent that fits, or maybe it's going to work without an extra diffuser.

1. 4x M3x50 hex key screw + nut for the lightbox
1. 4x M3x25 hex key screw + nut for the central tube and lens holder
